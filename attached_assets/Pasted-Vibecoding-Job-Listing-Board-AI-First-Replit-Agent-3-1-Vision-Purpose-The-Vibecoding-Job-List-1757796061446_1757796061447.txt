Vibecoding Job Listing Board (AI-First, Replit Agent 3)
1. Vision & Purpose

The Vibecoding Job Listing Board will be an AI-driven platform where creatives, coders, and entrepreneurs discover and share jobs, gigs, and collaborations. Unlike traditional job boards, this platform emphasizes “vibes over resumes” — personality, energy, and cultural fit matter as much as skills.

AI will power:

Automated job postings (from employers, freelancers, or AI agents scraping open roles).

Personalized vibe-based matching between candidates and roles.

Conversational interfaces for applicants and employers (AI agents assist in creating listings, writing applications, or scheduling interviews).

A fully automated coding + deployment workflow using Replit Agent 3, ensuring fast, iterative product evolution.
